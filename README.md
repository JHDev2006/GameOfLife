A simple implementation of Conways Game of Life, using CPP and SDL3, was simply made for fun / learning SDL3

I plan to optimize this ten fold, by rewriting the main system to utilize a 2 byte chunk system which will allow for things like infinite worlds

Not planning on having this be a big thing, <h1>dont open pull requests or issues</h1> i just have this here cause i think its interesting

<h1> use your brain to try and run it, if you dare... </h1>
im not writing a guide on how to build, its just sdl3 and a cmake thing, your smart, you can figure it out :)
